    "- Using actual behaviour as context, instead of derived content gets real beliefs. (what they do and decide instead of what they say they do or prefer). This is why stated beliefs are not as meaningful/useful - "

      "iMessageWed, Oct 2 at 08:29Hey, this is Douglas Hindson. I’m going to be in San Francisco for 2wks from the 13th Oct. I’d enjoy hanging out while I’m there. I’m staying with one of my university friends in the city.Wed, Oct 2 at 11:02Hello Douglas Hindson. Are you going to be in South Bay at all? If not, I can come up to SF whenever since it’s not too far.Ha, yes, excessively formal. I’ve never seen my full name in casual conversation before, feels bot-like. I don’t know the lay of the land, is that a region in LA or a region of san fran?Wed, Oct 2 at 17:34Haha yeah I don’t think I’ve ever heard someone call you Douglas. South Bay is closer to San Jose area. I live/work in Mountain View, but go up to SF fairly regularly since its pretty close and that’s usually where events are Wed, Oct 2 at 19:40I changed to Douglas when I left Canada, only Canadian people call me Doug, and you’re now nominally American.Ok cool, I have some plans, but lots of flexibility, so if there’s cool things to do there, I’m interested. If there’s better things in san Fran, that’s cool. I’ll tell you more specifics of availability/plans tomorrow.Thu, Oct 3 at 11:29Ok cool. As an American, I’ll try to refer to you as Douglas. Do I have to say it with a British accent? There isn’t a ton of interesting stuff to do in in Mountain View. If there are any California based activities that you’re interested in, we could also do that. Example surfing, mountain biking, parks or areas that you want to visit Thu, Oct 3 at 13:21Tolerable British accents aren’t accessible to some people, especially Americans. I don’t want to strain your tongue or my ears, so just make sure to say the word with respect.WIP calendar, still pretty flexible:Arrive Sunday 13thMondayBike around san fran?Drop-in https://www.crossfitalinea.com/visiting-athletes TuesdayOakland? Meet Ivan/Rachel/james?WednesdayGo to yosemite?ThursdayReturn from yosemite?- drop-in: https://www.fogcitycf.com/membership Friday 18thevening : leon bridgesSaturday / Sunday (meet ivan/rachel/james?)MondayOakland?Tuesday“North of city” things?WednesdayThursday FridayEvening: Toro Y moi?SaturdaySunday 27th Fly out (departs 1:30pm)I’d be super interested in mountain biking. I’m also planning on Yosemite mid-week if you’re interested, but might not be compatible with work.Fri, Oct 4 at 11:06I can’t do mid-week trips, and it’s looking like I won’t be in the area Oct 11-14, but am free the other 2 weekends that you’re here.Have you mountain biked before? I’m kind of bad but there’s a massive range of different trail difficulties around here with tons of rental shops. If your friends are also interested, we can plan accordinglySun, Oct 6 at 12:31Sorry for slow reply, I’m just getting ready to leave Ottawa and head to Toronto for the week before san Fran!I have, but I’m also not amazing. I bike in cities and not mountains. I have done like 3 “intermediate difficult” mountain biking routes before but I wouldn’t really do jumps with gaps. Rough te\n",
