Extract the underlying beliefs expressed by the author in the following text. For each belief, indicate its state (having, comprehending, transcending).

Text: "<insert text>"

Beliefs:
1. [Belief] - [State]
2. [Belief] - [State]

## Process experiments

1. Figure out the main ideas, themes, thesis, purpose of the text. Express each as a proposition (ex: "the sky is blue", not "blue skies").
2. For each expression, derive the most fundemental x relevant assumptions. (there can be more fundemental assumptions that are not as relevant - relevance is reducing the number of layers of beliefs between the assumption and the expression, while more fundemental assumptions depend on fewer beliefs)
3. For each assumption, determine its state within the piece (having, comprehending, transcending).

Option 1: break the piece into smaller passages and evaluate each passage, then combine the results.
Option 2: perform once for the overall piece.
Option 3: both high-level and low-level

### 2. Derive the most fundemental x relevant assumptions

#### Derive assumptions

#### Evaluate how fundemental the assumption is

#### Evaluate how relevant the assumption is

### 3. Determine the state of each assumption as a belief

Hypothesis disproving

Can I feel existential pain without changing my beliefs? Yes.
Can I stimulate a particular feeling repeatably? The feeling of comprehending/transcending a belief.
Can I identify a belief every time I feel comprehension/transcendence?
